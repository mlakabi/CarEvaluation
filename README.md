# CarEvaluation


A data science project that utilizes machine learning and inferential statistics to predict the condition of a used vehicle based on features about its main characteristics.

Using various predictive models like logistic regression, SVM, gradient boosting, and random forest classifiers we are able to predict the condition of a vehicle with up to 98% accuracy.
